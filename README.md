There is a description of a bug I detected in Revolut application

Bug report:

Reporter: Maksym Czerniawski
Summary: Pop-up window "Paste" is not appearing in the "E-mail" field when adding a new bank account in Transfers.
Revolut application version: 9.15

Operating system: iOS version 16.2
Priority: Trivial

Expected result: open the Revolut app → go to "Transfer" at the bottom → go to "+ New" in the top right corner  → go to "Bank recipient" at the top → scroll down → click in the "E-mail" field → try to click to evoke the pop-up window "Paste" →  the pop-up window appears, then paste the e-mail address in this field → e-mail address is inserted in the "E-mail" field.

Actual result: open the Revolut app → go to "Transfer" at the bottom → go to "+ New" in the top right corner  → go to "Bank recipient" at the top→ scroll down → click in the "E-mail" field → try to click to evoke the pop-up window "Paste" -> The pop-up windows does not appeared, instead, a round icon ("Add recipient") at the bottom right side is stretching out to the left corner for a bite of a second and turns back. It's not possible to paste a copied e-mail address into this field; only type it manually.

Additional information: the same bug is appearing when trying to add Business (instead of Individual) bank account.
